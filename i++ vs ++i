++i will increment the value beforehand and return the incremented value of i.
i=1;
j=++i;
return i, j;
i=2, j=2;

i++ will increment the value after its line is run. It will return the original value of i, and then increment the value of i.
i=1;
j=i++;
return i, j;
i=2, j=1;

for a for loop any kind is common. Prefer to use ++i to avoid confusion.

++i is performance-wise more efficient than i++, as the old value of i does not have to be stored for later use. However, the difference is trivial and often optimized the same way by the compiler.
