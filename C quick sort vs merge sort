Quick sort:
based on divide & conquer strategy.
The array of elements is divided repeatedly until it is not possible to divide it further.
Known as "partition exchange sort".
Uses "Pivot"(key element) for partitioning the elements.
One left partition contains all the smaller elements than the pivot.
One right partition contains all the greater elements than the pivot.
